	abstract = {This paper presents a model to simulate the electricity demand of a single household consisting of multiple individuals. The total consumption is divided into four main categories, namely cold appliances, heating, ventilation, and air conditioning, lighting, and energy consumed by household members’ activities. The ﬁrst three components are modeled using engineering physically-based models, while the activity patterns of individuals are modeled using a heterogeneous Markov chain. Using data collected by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, a case study for an average American household is developed. The data are used to conduct an in-sample validation of the modeled activities and a rigorous statistical validation of the predicted electricity demand against metered data is provided. The results show highly realistic patterns that capture annual and diurnal variations, load ﬂuctuations, and diversity between household conﬁguration, location, and size.},

	abstract = {The building sector accounts for 30\% of ﬁnal energy consumption and 28\% of global energy-related carbon dioxide emissions, with space heating and cooling consuming a large share of total buildings’ energy consumption. Building stock modelling for space heating and cooling energy prediction provides critical insights on the stock energy consumption and aid the building retroﬁt policy-making process with the evaluation of the energy-saving potential. By combining the physical modelling approach and datadriven approach, a hybrid approach is applicable for modelling the heating and cooling energy consumption of the building stock, including both residential buildings and non-residential buildings. Within this framework, the Urban Modelling Interface (UMI) tool has been used for physical modelling to generate heating and cooling energy use intensity. Then, ten different machine learning models, including Gaussian radial basis function kernel support vector regression, linear kernel support vector regression, polynomial kernel support vector regression, random forests, extreme gradient boosting, ordinary leastsquares linear regression, ridge regression, least absolute shrinkage and selection operator, elastic net and artiﬁcial neural network, have been applied to predict heating and cooling energy use intensity (EUI). The approach has been demonstrated using a case study in Chongqing, China. The results show that machine learning models can achieve accurate building heating and cooling EUI prediction, with the polynomial kernel support vector regression showing the best accuracy at the level of a single building, and the Gaussian radial basis function kernel support vector regression performing the best at the stock level. Machine learning models generated by proposed hybrid approach not only provide quickly prediction of building space heating and cooling energy consumption at the stock level, but also support building retroﬁt decision makings by evaluate energy saving potential of various retroﬁt options.},

	abstract = {The increase of power plants’ conversion eﬃciencies, together with the high share of renewable energy sources in the electricity production for some countries, pushes for the use of heat pumps for space heating when aiming at reducing the associated primary energy consumption. However, the eﬀective reduction of primary energy consumption should be supported by careful evaluations, as a number of parameters inﬂuence the heat pumps performance, including outdoor temperature, supply temperature, heat load and electricity primary energy factor. The variability of such parameters increases the complexity of the analysis, and annual or monthly average calculations might lead to incomplete evaluations and thus to sub-optimal solutions. This paper performs a hourly simulation of the operation of an air-source heat pump for space heating, relying on the available heat demand data of real buildings currently connected to a district heating network. In addition, the paper proposes the calculation of the hourly primary energy factor of the electricity supplied by the power grid, as the variability of the generation sources plays a key role in the global analysis of the energy system’s conversion eﬃciency. The results show that in all the considered cases the heat pumps provide potential primary energy savings compared to natural gas boilers, thanks to the combined eﬀect of their high coeﬃcient of performance and the low electricity primary energy factor in the analyzed context. The primary energy consumption reduction obtained in each case is in the range 10–40\%, with a median value close to 30\%. Moreover, the comparison between average and high-resolution calculations of primary energy factors shows the possible underestimation of the potential primary energy savings when yearly or monthly data are adopted.},

	abstract = {Addressing the growing concerns of climate change necessitates the decarbonisation of energy sectors globally. Heating is the largest energy end-use, accounting for almost half of total energy consumption in most countries. This paper presents an extensive review of previous works on several aspects of heat pumps, including their role in the decarbonisation of the heating sector. In addition, themes related to recent technological advances of heat pumps, as well as, their roles in terms of adding flexibility to renewable-rich systems and carbon abatement are examined. Challenges and barriers facing large-scale deployment of heat pumps are identified. Generally, as the share of renewables in the energy mix increases, heat pumps can play a role in addressing a multitude of problems induced by climate change. The potential of heat pumps to abate emissions, however, is highly de­ pendent on the type of technology, location and electricity mix. Heat pumps can be a source of flexibility in the power system and can upgrade waste heat to provide low-cost heating in district heating networks. They are environment friendly and provide a viable pathway for decarbonising the heating sector. However, economic, regulatory, structural and infrastructural barriers exist, which may hinder heat pump integration rate.},

	abstract = {Silicon based modules have been installed since the beginning of the commercial development of the PV technology, and still represent an important share of the global PV market. However, they are penalised when cells reach high temperatures, with a worsening of the conversion efﬁciency due to thermal drift. Several cooling techniques have been proposed to attenuate this drawback, where water- and air-based solutions have proved to be the most effective and applicable, even though issues related to deterioration of front glass optical properties and thermal shock may occur. In order to overcome these limitations, in this paper the authors report the performances of three different cooling systems operating on the PV module back surface over an acquisition period of eight months. Two systems are based on a spray cooling mechanism whereas the third exploits the forced ventilation of a cavity placed under the module. Data were monitored on the experimental set-up located on the building roof of the Department of Mechanical Engineering of University of Calabria (Italy). Results demonstrate the excellent performance of a simple spray cooling system, able to generate a monthly energy increase up to 8.6\%, with a global water consumption of 2.78 m3 in the whole analysed period, whereas the employment of more complex systems based on mechanical ventilation proved to be ineffective for cooling applications.},

In the warm seasons, temperature in the greenhouse may exceed the optimal temperature for cultivated plants. In order to have the desired temperature for a greenhouse in summer, it must be cooled as quickly as it gains heat from the ambient. For reducing the internal heat of the greenhouse and heat discharge, the greenhouse needs to be coupled with a proper cooling system based on the climatic conditions of the region. This article focuses on the current greenhouse cooling methods and compares them with modern, renewable energy-based methods with the aim of using clean energy, reducing the possible potential of environmental damage, as well as reducing energy consumption and also using winter energy storage like solar energy and applying for the greenhouse cooling demands in warm seasons.},
