# Modelling cooling demand and PV production

- Cooling model for houses in different countries in Python
- PV production depending on latitude in R

**House.py**:
To change the model implementation
Here is the whole House model and calculation algorithm.

**elec_demand.py**:
To create Houses with different parameters and run the simulation
In elec_dem.py you can create Houses, simulate the inside temperature over the year, and gather AC/HP consumption.
