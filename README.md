# Matching Residential Cooling Demand With Rooftop PV
## Overview
This project aims to model and analyze the potential for matching residential cooling demand with energy generated from rooftop photovoltaic (PV) systems. The analysis includes modelling of single and multi family houses in different countries all over europe, modelling electricity generated by PV modules over the year with different tilt angles and orientations, performing sensitivity analysis on the key parameters, and exploring opportunities for future extensions.

## Building Model & Features

A combination of old, modern & single, multi family houses are defined resulting in a total of 4 different house types used in this simulation. 
The features of the house are listed here:
- A battery with a defined capacity and throughput
- AC Unit & heatpump with a setpoint & coefficient of performance (COP) for each
- PV roof coverage
- Dimensions (walls, windows, floor, height)
- Solar heat gain coefficient (SHGC)
- Insulation parameters for walls, windows, floor
- Inertia of the house consisting of the air inside + walls made out of concrete

All these parameters can be changed in *parameters.py* & the logic of the calculation can be found in *House.py*

## Solar Model

Using the solaR package in R the PV Generation is calculated over the whole year for a given latitude and solar irradiation.
PV Generation is calculated in the solaR folder.

## Inputs to run the Simulation

There 2 inputs which have to be downloaded prior to running the model:
- Solar irradiation 
- Outside temperature

In this project all data regarding these 2 variables has been downloaded from **renewables.ninja**
